## Organizations - to do


**Glide Memorial Church<**:

* Our Women’s Center is a safe and supportive community that empowers survivors of domestic and intimate partner violence, including stalking, to heal and thrive. Through changing core beliefs and core values, we help you create long-term behavioral change. If you are a woman who has slipped through the social safety net, is living on the street or in an unstable housing situation, we’re here for you.

* We are a domestic violence program with a unique approach to transforming lives.  We provide holistic healing; addressing emotions, mind, body, spirit and relationships. Our services are designed to help women who face Intimate partner violence, and associated concerns such as co-dependence, substance abuse, mental health issues and homelessness.  We move survivors of violence from crisis to confidence, from hopelessness to long term change.

**St. Anthony’s**:

* https://www.stanthonysf.org

**St. Vincent de Paul Society**:

* http://svdp-sf.org

**Concrn.org**:

* Compassionate crisis response for neighbors. We are a compassionate social service network that connects people in need to volunteer responders trained in crisis intervention and mediation.

* Concerned citizens can download our mobile app on iPhone or Android or call us directly to access our services. We make it easy for both witnesses and victims of nonviolent crises to create a report and directly dispatch our network.

* We believe that this &ldquo;Compassionate Response&rdquo; model is more humane, harm-reducing, and cost-effective than a law enforcement approach to non-violent crises.

* If it’s not during the hours that the Mobile Crisis Team is open, and it’s not in the Tenderloin (which is where Concrn.org serves) call 311. Explain to them the situation and ask for them to send out the Homelessness Outreach Team.
